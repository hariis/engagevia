Have you ever felt the need to discuss, share, get advice and recommendations, brainstorm, collaborate on certain topics that may sometimes be semi-confidential with friends whom you know and trust (i.e.those in your address book) and also possibly with friends of your friends that share the interest on that particular topic ?
You get a targeted & trusted & confidential group of friends you can rely on to engage that is tailored to your needs and circumstances.

What does EngageVia do?

When you have one of these urges,

   1.  click on the Ev link and hop on over to set up a pad or a lounge if you will
   2.  invite relevant friends from your address book and/or twitter followers.
   3.  You can set it up to enable your invitees to invite relevant friends from their circle as well.
   4.  All the invitees can visit the lounge and chime in on the topic of your post.


Whether you want product/service recommendations, brainstorm on something you recently read, collaborate on your "break through" idea,
 EngageVia provides you one place and lots of tools
to gather and organize all the input from your circle and your extendend circle,
so you can rest easy.
