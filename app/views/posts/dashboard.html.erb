<h2>
The Need & Desire
</h2>
<p>
Have you ever felt the need to discuss, get feedback, advice and recommendations, brainstorm & collaborate with friends
whom you may know and trust (i.e.those in your address book)
and also possibly with friends of your friends that share the interest on that particular topic
who may understand your needs and circumstances better and hence provide input tailored to you?
</p>
    <h2>
    How can EngageVia help?
    </h2>
<p>
 EngageVia provides you one place and lots of tools (coming soon - polls, wikis and more)
to request, gather and organize all of the input from your circle and your extended circle of friends.
